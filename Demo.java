Subject: Request for Availability During Production Release on September 30

Hi [Recipient's Name],

As we approach the production release scheduled for **Monday, September 30**, could you please let us know once the changes have been moved to the production environment? This will allow us to notify our users to begin testing in the production environment.

Since both the standard login and SSO options will be available in production, itâ€™s not a critical concern. However, it would be greatly appreciated if you could be available during the Monday morning EST window. This will allow us to reach out to you in case we encounter any issues connecting to Pirum via SSO.

Please let me know if you are open to being available during that time.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

  Subject: Request for AD Group Creation in Agnes for SSO Integration with Pirum

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

This email is regarding an external vendor, Pirum, which uses Agnes to grant access to users for connecting to their platform. Currently, Pirum is utilizing user ID and password authentication to connect to their portal, but we are transitioning to SSO in order to comply with UBS's requirement for two-factor authentication.

We are implementing Azure SSO for this integration and need to add approximately 250 users to the Azure application. Instead of manually adding each user, we propose creating a new AD group where all users can be added. This AD group can then be linked to the Azure application. This approach will allow us to manage user access more efficiently without depending on another team, as we can directly add or remove users from the AD group.

Since Agnes is used as the access control platform for Pirum, could you please confirm if we can create the AD group in Agnes and manage users within this group?

Additionally, please let me know if I need to raise any tickets to facilitate the creation of the AD group in Agnes.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
