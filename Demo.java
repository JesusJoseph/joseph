I hope this email finds you well. We are preparing for an upcoming production release and would like to request your assistance in planning for the transition.

Our approach for this release is to maintain both the old login system and the new SSO sign-in simultaneously. This will help ensure a seamless transition, preventing any outages even if some users are not ready to switch over immediately.

Could you please help us coordinate this process and ensure that everything is set up for a smooth deployment? Your support in executing this plan will be greatly appreciated.

Feel free to reach out if you need any further information, and please let us know if there are any additional considerations on your end.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
