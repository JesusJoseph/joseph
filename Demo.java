Subject: Important Update: SSO Integration and Required Actions for Your Team

Dear [Team Lead's Name],

We are in the process of integrating Single Sign-On (SSO) on our website for enhanced security and seamless access. To ensure a smooth transition, please take the following actions for your team:

Ensure SSO Access: All your team members must access the application using SSO. The standard email and password login will no longer be supported. Please verify that every team member is using SSO to log in.

Install Microsoft Authenticator: It is mandatory for all users to install the Microsoft Authenticator mobile app on their devices. This app will be used for multi-factor authentication (MFA) when accessing the application.

Azure AD Group Membership: Please confirm that all your team members are added to the relevant Azure Active Directory (AD) group to allow them access to the application.

Your prompt attention to these steps will ensure that your team can continue to access the application securely and without disruption.

If you have any questions or require assistance, feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
