Subject: Request for Steps to Access Production Environment Using SSO

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for your email. 

When we began UAT testing, we received a document from George outlining the steps to follow for UAT testing, which was very helpful. As we approach the production phase, could you please share a similar document detailing the steps required to access the program in the production environment using SSO? 

This would be greatly beneficial for us to ensure a smooth connection to Pirum via SSO.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

  Subject: Clarification on Access Request Changes Post-SSO Implementation

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

This email is to inquire about how the process for handling access requests will change once we move from normal login to SSO login. 

Currently, in UBS, when a new user needs access to Pirum, we manually grant them access and assign all the required permissions. With the shift to SSO, could you please clarify how this process will change? Specifically, I would like to understand if there are any new procedures or additional steps we need to follow to add a new user after the transition to SSO login.

Itâ€™s important for us to ensure that we are fully aligned on the updated process and that nothing is overlooked as we make this transition.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
