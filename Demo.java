Regarding UAT and production, I wanted to update you on a couple of points:

Even after we provide the UAT sign-off, the U80 users will still be required to perform unit testing. Therefore, we need to maintain both SSO and the standard login options, even after the UAT sign-off is completed.

Once they give the sign-off by this Friday, the next step is to move the changes to production. However, the production environment should only be activated on September 30, as that is the official production date provided by UBSI.
