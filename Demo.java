**Subject:** Confirmation of SSO Setup: Azure AD and ISSO Federation

Dear [Vendor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

We are in the process of setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) for our integration, and I would like to confirm the following details regarding our respective setups:

- **Our Side:** We are using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as our Identity Provider (IdP), configured to use SAML 2.0 as the authentication protocol.
- **Vendor's Side:** As per our discussions, we understand that you are using ISSO Federation on your side to handle SSO.

To ensure a smooth and successful integration, please confirm that the above details align with your setup. If there are any discrepancies or additional information needed from our side, kindly let us know so we can address them promptly.

Once confirmed, we can proceed with the necessary metadata exchange and configuration steps to establish the trust relationship between our systems.

Thank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Position]  
[Your Company Name]  
[Your Contact Information]
