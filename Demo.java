Subject: Request for Confirmation on UAT Sign-Off and Production Timeline

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on the email I sent earlier regarding the UAT and production environments. 

As mentioned, we are providing the UAT sign-off, but I need confirmation on a few points:

1. **Unit Testing for U80 Users**: Even after the UAT sign-off, U80 users will still be required to perform unit testing. To accommodate this, we need to maintain both the SSO and standard login options post-UAT sign-off. Could you please confirm if this is agreed upon?

2. **Production Go-Live**: Once the UAT sign-off is completed by Friday, we will proceed with moving the changes to production. However, as per the timeline provided by UBSI, the production environment should only go live on **September 30**. Please confirm that this schedule is still on track.

Your confirmation on these points is critical as we prepare for the next steps.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
